# Competitive Programming Solutions
The table below is a rough estimate of number of problems solved based on the code I have saved from multiple accounts I have. Some pieces of code are probably written back in 2012, when things are pretty different. I am never really great at competitive programming. The best I've ever got is a bronze medal in National Olympiad in Informatics, China, but it's pretty much similar to a souls-like game, where you suffer, learn and enjoy.
